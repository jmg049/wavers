# Getting Started
This sections provides a quick overview of the functionality offered by WaveRs to help you get started quickly. WaveRs allows the user to read, write and perform conversions between different types of sampled audio, currently, ``i16``, ``i32``, ``f32`` and ``f64``, but ``i24`` in future.

For more details on the project and wav files see the [WaveRs Project](#the-wavers-project) section below. For more detailed information on the functionality offered by WaveRs see the [the docs](https://docs.rs/wavers).

## Reading

```rust
use wavers::{Wav, read};

fn main() {
	let fp: Path = Path::new("path/to/wav.wav")
	
	// read a wav file as PCM_16 (may perform a conversion)
	let i16_wav: Wav<i16> = read::<i16>(&fp).unwrap();
	let i16_samples: &[i16] = i16_wav.as_ref();
	
	// Alternatively, if we know the wav file encoding (we'll assume Float32)
	let f32_wav: Wav<f32> = Wav::<f32>::read(&fp).unwrap();
	let f32_samples: &[f32] = f32_wav.as_ref();
}
```


## Conversion
```rust
use wavers::{Wav, read, ConvertTo};

fn main() {
	let fp: Path = Path::new("path/to/wav.wav")
	
	
	let i16_wav: Wav<i16> = Wav<i16>::read(&fp).unwrap();
	// if we already have a wav file that we want to convert
	let f32_wav: Wav<f32> = i16_wav.convert();
	
	// We want to open and convert if necessary
	let f32_wav: Wav<f32> = read::<f32>(&fp).unwrap(); 
}
```

## Writing
```rust
use wavers::{Wav, write};

fn main() {
	let fp: Path = Path::new("path/to/wav.wav");
	let out_fp: Path = Path::new("out/path/to/wav.wav");
	
	let mut i16_wav: Wav<i16> = Wav<i16>::read(&fp).unwrap();
	// Some code that modifies the wav data
	
	i16_wav.write(&out_fp).unwrap();
	// or we can convert and write
	i16_wav.write_as::<f32>(&out_fp).unwrap();
}
```



## Wav Utilities

```rust
use wavers::{WavEncoding, FmtChunk, fmt, sample_rate, n_channels, encoding, duration, durationf};

fn main() {
	let fp: Path = Path::new("path/to/wav.wav");
	
	// Get the sample rate
	let sample_rate: u32 = sample_rate(&fp).unwrap();
	
	// Get the number of channels
	let n_channels: u16 = n_channels(&fp).unwrap();
	
	// Get the encoding (the sample type)
	let encoding: WavEncoding = encoding(&fp).unwrap();
	
	// Get the duration in seconds (will perform rounding)
	let wav_duration: u64 = duration(&fp).unwrap();
	
	// Get the duration in seconds as a float (will not perform rounding)
	let wav_duration: f32 = durationf(&fp).unwrap();
	
	// Get all fmt info
	let wav_info: FmtChunk = fmt(&fp).unwrap();
}
```

## Features
The following section describes the features available in the WaveRs crate. Some will modify how WaveRs works internally, such as SIMD and Rayon, whereas the likes of Ndarray provide addtional functionality to you, the user.

### Ndarray


The ``ndarray`` feature is used to provide functions that allow wav files to be read as ``ndarray`` 2-D arrays (samples x channels). There are two functions provided, ``into_ndarray`` and ``as_ndarray``. ``into_ndarray`` consumes the samples and ``as_ndarray`` creates a ``CowArray`` from the samples.

```rust
use wavers::{read, Wav, AsNdarray, IntoNdarray};
use ndarray::{Array2, CowArray2};

fn main() {
	let fp: Path = Path::new("path/to/wav.wav")
	let i16_wav: Wav<i16> = read::<i16>(&fp).unwrap();
	let i16_array: Array2<i16> = i16_wav.into_ndarray().unwrap();
	
	let i16_wav: Wav<i16> = read::<i16>(&fp).unwrap();
	let i16_array: CowArray2<i16> = i16_wav.as_ndarray().unwrap();
}

```

### SIMD
The simd feature flag enables the use of explicit SIMD operations using the ``packed_simd`` crate. It can provide a small performance boost when converting between the different audio sample types. See the benchmarks for some numbers.

### Rayon
This feature enables the use of the ``rayon`` crate during sample conversion. 
# The WaveRs Project
There were several motivating factors when deciding to write Wavers. Firstly, my PhD involves quite a bit of audio processing and I have been working almost exclusively with wav files using Python. Python is a fantastic language but I have always had issues with aspects such as baseline memory usage. Secondly, after being interested in learning a more low-level language and not being bothered with the likes of C/C++ (again), Rust caught my attention. Thirdly, I had to do a Speech and Audio processing module, which involved a project. Mixing all of these together led me to start this project and gave me a deadline and goals for an MVP of Wavers.

Rust also has a limited number of audio-processing libraries and even fewer specific to the wav format. Currently, the most popular wav reader/writer crate is [hound](https://github.com/ruuda/hound), by ruuda. Hound is currently used as the **wav file reader/writer** for other Rust audio libraries such as [Rodio](https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio), **but Hound was last updated in September 2022**. The biggest **general-purpose audio-processing** library for Rust though is [CPAL](https://github.com/rustaudio/cpal). CPAL, the Cross-Platform Audio Library is a low-level library for audio input and output in pure Rust. Finally, there is also [Symphonia](https://github.com/pdeljanov/Symphonia), another general-purpose media encoder/decoder crate for Rust. Symphonia supports the reading and writing of wav files.  Both ``CPAL`` and ``Symphonia`` are very low level and do not offer the ease of use that ``WaveRs`` strives for.

## Project Goals

## Anatomy of Wav File
The wave file format is a widely supported format for storing digital audio. A wave file uses the Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF) file structure and organizes the data in the file in chunks. Each chunk contains information about its type and size and can easily be skipped by software that does not understand the specific chunk type.

Excluding the RIFF chunk there is no guaranteed order to the remaining chunks and only the fmt and data chunk are guaranteed to exist. This means that rather than a specific structure for decoding chunks, chunks must be discovered by seeking through the wav file and reading the chunk ID and chunk size fields. Then if the chunk is needed, read the chunk according to the chunk format, and if not, skip ahead by the size of the chunk. 

The chunk types supported and used by Wavers are described below. There are plans to expand the number of supported chunks as time goes on and the library matures.

## <u>RIFF</u>  
Total Bytes = 8 + 4 for the Chunk name + the size of the rest of the file less 8 bytes for the Chunk ID and size.

| Byte Sequence Description | Length(Bytes) | Offset(Bytes) | Description |
|:---| :---: |:---: |:---|
| Chunk ID                  | 4             | 0      | The character string "RIFF"|
| Size| 4 | 4 | The size, in bytes of the chunk|
| RIFF type ID | 4 | 8 | The character string "WAVE"|
| Chunks | $x$ |  12 | The other chunks |

## <u>fmt </u> 
Total bytes = 16 + 4 for the chunk size + 4 for the chunk name

| Byte Sequence Description | Length(Bytes) | Offset(Bytes) | Description |
|:---| :---: |:---: |:---|
| Chunk ID                  | 4             | 0      | The character string "fmt " (note the space!)|
| Size| 4 | 4 | The size, in bytes of the chunk|
| Compression Code | 2 | 6 | Indicates the format of the wav file, e.g. PCM = 1 and IEEE Float = 3|
| Number of Channels | 2 |  8 | The number of channels in the wav file |
| Sampling Rate | 4 |  12 | The rate at which the audio is sampled |
| Byte Rate | 4 |  16 | Bytes per second |
| Block Align | 2 |  18 | Minimum atomic unit of data |
| Bits per Sample | 2 |  20 | The number of bits per sample, e.g. PCM_16 has 16 bits |

## <u>Data Chunk</u>

Total bytes = 4 for the chunk name + 4 for the size and then $x$ bytes for the data.

| Byte Sequence Description | Length(Bytes) | Offset(Bytes) | Description |
|:---| :---: |:---: |:---|
| Chunk ID                  | 4             | 0      | The character string "data" |
| size | 4 | 4 | The size of the data in bytes |
| data | $x$ | 8 | The encoded audio data |
